# BNBU-FM Course Guide
[中文](./README.md)|English

## Preface  
Gathering course materials is an essential skill for every university student, but finding what you need in the vast ocean of information is often tedious and challenging. I’ve personally experienced the frustration of eagerly searching for next semester’s course materials during winter/summer break, only to return to campus and realize the only thing matching between what I found and the actual lectures was the title. Or worse, facing a quiz the next day with only a handful of practice problems provided all semester, leaving you nervously entering the exam hall and walking out dejected.  

Although the university offers ISpace, course materials are only accessible to students enrolled in that semester, making it extremely unfriendly for those who want to prepare in advance. Some instructors don’t even provide notes—if you don’t jot them down during class, you’re out of luck. When you turn to the internet instead of ISpace, you might stumble upon UC Berkeley or Princeton’s course slides, only to find they’re completely irrelevant to your instructor’s content. All these scenarios push poor FMers to the brink of despair.  

This project aims to compile past course materials—lecture slides, notes, assignments, and exams—to benefit countless FMers. We can start with MR and ME courses and, as the project grows, expand to include popular GE and FE courses. Eventually, it could even evolve into a course guide for the entire FST or BNBU. However, I know this is far beyond what I can achieve alone, so I’m calling on everyone to join this project and make it a resource that benefits all FMers and even the broader BNBU community!
